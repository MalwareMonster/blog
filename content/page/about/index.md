Hello Friend,\
\
Allow me to introduce my self. My name is Mal Im a security researcher / penetration tester / hacker. I've being hacking things for as far back as I can remember whether it is taking apart my toys as a child and building small robots or hacking web applications . Needless to say I've always enjoyed breaking things as a way to figure out how they work.\
\
I have 2 years exerience working as a penetration tester with a strong focus on web and API penetration testing. Although Im looking to expand my horrizons into a more red team orientated position as I move forward in the secruity industry \
\
I hope to use this blog to make note of things that I think are cool and log my progress into becoming a 1337 hacker <3
